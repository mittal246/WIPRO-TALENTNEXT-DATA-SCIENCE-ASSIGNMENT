#1. Create a model that will predict the rating based on the feedback of customer.
# Dataset- yelp.csv

# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("yelp.csv")

# Features (reviews) and Labels (stars)
X = df['text']        # customer feedback
y = df['stars']       # rating (1â€“5 stars)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Convert text into TF-IDF features
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=5000)

# Train Logistic Regression Model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Evaluation
