#1. Create a model that will predict the rating based on the feedback of customer.
# Dataset- yelp.csv

# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("yelp.csv")

# Features (reviews) and Labels (stars)
X = df['text']        # customer feedback
y = df['stars']       # rating (1–5 stars)

# Train-test split

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Evaluation
